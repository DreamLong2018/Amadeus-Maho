#Amadeus: Maho Hiyajo Version
Welcome! This is an alternate version of Yink and Emojikage's Amadeus App starring our favorite loli, Maho Hiyajo. It is currently still in the Alpha stage and has a few bugs, but has a variety of features as well. Kurisu still takes priority over Maho, however, so it will take longer to update her. 

#Features:
<li>Around 20 different lines
<li>Voice Commands (try loli, short, kid, hello, good morning, Kurisu, we did it, nice, etc.)
<li>Jojo References
<li>EXPERIMENTAL: Click small logo to trigger early stage alarm activity.

#Credits:
Thank you especially to Yink and Emojikage for the original code and frequent updates. Also thanks to Valkyrio100 for various voice lines.
