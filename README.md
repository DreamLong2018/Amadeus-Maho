# Amadeus
A side project that aims to replicate the Amadeus App shown in Steins;Gate 0 for Android.

I'm creating this mainly for cosplay purposes, thus the design takes priority over actual functionality.
Hit me up on the Steins;Gate Discord.

To start speech recognition simply touch her once. If you long-click her, she will go on a loop and say random sentences in random intervals. Long-Click again to stop.

#Recognized commands
Keep in mind that the voice recognition is Japanese in order to register the Japanese names. Thus you may have to alter your pronouncation a bit.
